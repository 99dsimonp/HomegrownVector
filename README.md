# HomegrownVector
Yet another simple, fast, and modern vector implementation. 
Uses C arrays for speed and modern C++ features such as templates, initializer lists, and range-based loops for ease of use. 

This small program was implemented as a personal learning exercise to gain a better understanding of the underlying techniques of the C++ data structures. 
Next I plan to time this implementation against std::vector and look into the std::vector implementation to see what I missed.
